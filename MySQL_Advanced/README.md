## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Requirements
#### General
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## More Info
#### Comments for your SQL file:
$ cat my_script.sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
$
#### Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL
- Ask for container Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7
- Connect via SSH
- Or via the WebTerminal
- In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:

$ service mysql start
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.30 is started
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p my_database
Enter password: 
Database
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
$

#### In the container, credentials are root/root

### How to import a SQL dump
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 
$ curl "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password: 
$ echo "SELECT * FROM tv_genres" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password:
