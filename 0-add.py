def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # This is the function definition for 'add'.
    # 'def' is the keyword used to define a function in Python.

    # The function 'add' takes two parameters, 'a' and 'b'.
    # 'a: float' and 'b: float' are type annotations.
    # These annotations specify that both 'a' and 'b' should be of type float.

    # '-> float' is a return type annotation.
    # This indicates that the function will return a value of type float.

    return a + b  
    # The 'return' statement sends back the result of 'a + b' to where the function was called.
    # This line performs the addition of 'a' and 'b' and returns the sum.
